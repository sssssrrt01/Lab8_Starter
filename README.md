Paragraph: Graceful degradation is something we must consider -- we would of course want to build web apps to be compatible with the most recent browsers. However, an issue that I ran into while doing this lab is that my default browser did not support PWAs. It got me thinking that this page must still be designed to be usable with backwards compatibility. In some ways, service workers operate similarly -- it allows us to continue to access something when a device is more "backwards", at a time where it has no network access for exmaple.
